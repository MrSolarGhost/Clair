# Collections Screen

Collections are user-curated playlists of games.

They are intentionally lightweight and flexible.

Users can:
- Create and delete collections
- Add or remove games
- Browse collections like mini-libraries
- Use a collection as a Home shortcut
- Use a collection as the source for Tonight’s Pick

Collections exist to support intention, not hoarding.
