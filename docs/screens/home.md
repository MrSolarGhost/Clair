# Home Screen

- Acts as the console-style landing view for the day.
- Highlights a curated “what to play next” stack, quick launch shortcuts, and ongoing progress cards.
- Navigation is controller-first; the focused card is always highlighted and actionable.
- Touch brings an item into focus and can directly open the selected entry.

The Home screen exists to answer one question:

**“What should I play right now?”**

It is a widget-based dashboard designed to reduce friction and choice overload.

Typical widgets include:

- Continue Playing
- Tonight’s Pick
- Recently Played
- Unfinished Games
- Shortcuts to Systems or Collections

# Tonight’s Pick
A curated recommendation shown prominently.

The source is configurable by the user:
- Currently Playing games
- A specific Collection

If the chosen source is empty, Clair falls back automatically to avoid showing an empty state.
