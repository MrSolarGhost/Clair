# Game Card

Every game has a dedicated **Game Card**, which acts as the central hub for that game.

From the Game Card, the user can:
- Launch the game
- Change its play status
- View achievements
- Open notes
- Open guides
- Add or remove the game from collections

The Game Card also shows relevant context such as:
- Current status
- Last played
- Associated notes or guides

All deeper interactions originate here.
