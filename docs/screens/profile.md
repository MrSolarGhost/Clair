# Profile

The Profile section represents the local player.

It shows:
- Game counts by status
- Recent activity
- Achievement summaries
- Entry point to settings

The Profile is local-only and does not require an account.

The profile page should be 100% customizable. The colors, fonts, images, widgets, etc.

It must be able to be saved as a snapshot to send to friends as QR.
