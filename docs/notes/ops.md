# Ops Reference

## Logging and Debugging

Logs must:
- Be human readable
- Clearly describe failure states
- Avoid excessive verbosity in production

⸻

## Testing Philosophy

Clair values reliability over coverage metrics.

Agents should prioritize testing:
- Game detection accuracy
- Launch behavior
- Data persistence
- Input navigation

⸻

## Anti-Goals

Clair is NOT:
- A social platform
- A store
- A game downloader
- An emulator
- A streaming service

Agents must not introduce features aligned with these goals.
