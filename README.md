# Clair

Clair is a controller-first game frontend for Android and PC that feels like a console OS.
It helps you decide what to play, keep track of progress, and stay inside a calm, focused gaming space.

Clair is a frontend only.
It does not emulate games.
It launches console-forward emulators and organizes everything around play.

## Core Philosophy

- Feels like a console, not a phone
- Controller-first, touch-responsive
- Calm, soft UI that reduces decision fatigue
- Offline-first, no required accounts or servers
- Encourages playing and finishing games

## Input Model

Clair is **controller-first**, but fully supports touch.

- Every screen is navigable with a controller.
- Every interactive element responds to touch.
- Touch interaction moves focus to the touched element, so controller use can continue seamlessly.

- Gestures are optional and never required.
